# Bash Shell
### Introduction
In this essay I am going to talk about everything that I have learned on this subject “Structured Programming” since we started this second quarter. I will explain all that I know and I can recall about the command line and all the codes that the teacher taught us during the few classes that we had. I have to say that I didn’t know a thing about programming before, but I think it is very important to have all this concepts very clear to be able to become a good programmer.
### Development
The command line, command screen, or text interface, is a user interface that's navigated by typing commands at prompts, instead of using a mouse. Unlike a GUI (graphical user interface) operating system, a command line only uses a keyboard to navigate by entering commands and does not utilize a mouse for navigating. It processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.
To apply this commands we used a console called git bash, in this program we could start writing our first steps and practicing with all those commands that the teacher told us, which I will talk about in this essay.
To make an easier comprehension of the text we will use the words filename, directoryname, branchname to describe that there it goes the name of the file, directory, branch or whatever we are using.
**pwd**
This is usually the first command that I enter and it prints the name of the working directory
**ls**
This command is used to list all the directories and files that are inside the directory where we are located.
**cd directoryname**
This command is used to jump into one directory, but it has to be inside the directory where we are currently located.
**cd ..**
This one is used to go back and navigate backwards among the directories.
**mkdir directoryname**
This command means make directory, and you create one writing the name of the new directory.
**rmdir directoryname**
Just the opposite, this command removes the directory entered.
**nano filename.txt**
With this command we use nano to create a text file, it opens a new tab where you write the information that you want, then we close it the changes are saved. This file can be with any text extension (.txt, .md, .py, or any other).
**mv filename.txt newfilename.txt**
This command is used to change the name of a text file, we first type the current file name and the new one.
**cp filename.txt otherfilename.txt**
This one is used to copy a file, we first type the name of the file we are copying and then the name that the new file will have.
**cat filename.txt**
We use this display the text that is written inside of a text file.
**tac filename.txt**
This is similar to cat but this display the text backwards.
**head filename.txt**
It shows the first 10 lines of the text file.
**head –n 5 filename.txt**
With this command we can change the amount of lines that are shown, as an example I put 5, but you can type the number that you prefer, and it will show that amount of lines of the file. In this case the first 5.
**tail filename.txt**
This will show you the last 10 lines of the text file.
**tail –n 5 filename.txt**
The same as we did before, it will show you the last 5 lines, but you can change that number.
**wc filename.txt**
With this command you are able to see the amount of words and lines that the text file has.
**history**
This command shows all the commands that you have used, every step that you have made if you want to recall any command you previously entered.
### Conclusion
I would say that those are the main commands to start working on git bash, we can do a lot of things to get started with them and it is very important to know the functions of all of them. I hope to learn much more throughout this quarter because I really like everything that I am learning so far.
